Description
-----------
This is a moonlanding-like game written in C++/SDL.
The game is at a very early development stage. At this point
all it does is just move the ship on the screen using some basic
physics simulation and show some ship status information at the
bottom of the screen.

Building
--------
You will need the SDL and SDL-gfx libraries installed in order to
build this program.
Makefile is provided for building with make.

Comments
--------
Please note this is not intended to be a "real" game. I wrote it
as a start point to learn C++.
